             <h3> Sam Wellard - s3921205 </h3>
             <br />
             <p> I have always had an interest in IT. Whether it was playing PC games with my brother when I was at primary school or wanting to understand how to connect my iPod and iPad to iTunes to download music, apps and videos. Figuring out how to navigate the different interfaces of a PC, iPod and iPad were fun and challenging yet ‘basic’. My experience with IT before 2019 had been very surface level. <br /> </p>
             <p> What sparked me to want to have a deeper understanding of IT was the show Mr. Robot. While there is action away from laptops and PC’s, a lot of what matters and dictates the story is done through networking and the Command Line Interface. The show does a decent job at allowing people with no IT knowledge to know what’s happening in a broad narrative sense. I did feel lost at times when the characters were in front of their screens, which prompted me to study Cyber Security Certificate IV at Tafe in 2019. Within that course I was introduced to virtual machines, Splunk, networking and even wrote our own pen testing and IRTX project together in a group. As interesting and fun as the course was, I wouldn’t say it was enough to propel you straight into the workforce. That’s why I have decided to pursue further study at RMIT. </p>

             <h3> Callum Harper - s3815868 </h3>
             <br />
             <p> Hello everyone, my names Callum harper, I am currently 20 years old with the mind of a child and often feel like I am in my 70s, I am also currently studying a Bachelor of Business and financial planning. <br />  </p>
             <p> I live in reginal Victoria with my family, I have a twin brother Lyndon and a little brother Rhys, I would like to think of myself as a bit of a clown I love to joke around and make situations fun. My hobbies are sports, gaming, music, and bodybuilding also cooking but more importantly eating said cooking so when I am not studying or gaming, I am usually working in the gym or playing guitar and working on my own music, my favourite type of music is pop punk, metal or 90s grunge/rock.  </p>
             <br />
             <h3> Divy Pota - s3921363 </h3>
             <br />
             <p> My name is Divyanshu Pota, or Divy for short, aka s3921363. I grew up in Canberra with my parents and two younger sisters. <br /> </p>
             <p> My dad is an academic in the field of electrical and mechanical engineering, and I was fortunate to be introduced to computers and programming in the mid-90s. I started learning simple HTML tags and some Visual Basic, and later JavaScript. In 2001, I came across a mind-blowing piece of software which could be installed on my computer at home and used to create electronic music. I quickly forgot about writing code and became obsessed with writing songs. After completing year 12 and two painfully unsuccessful years of Medical Science at ANU, I moved to Sydney to pursue music full time. The computer had changed the outcome of my life already.
             <p> Out of all the skills which separate people in a hyper-competitive industry like song writing, having some basic knowledge of coding and the logic of talking to a computer probably helped me more than anything else. Like many other industries, music making has shifted to the digital realm, and is on the verge of incorporating exciting technologies like AI and ML. Having been using the first generation of music software for so many years, I would love to somehow be involved in creating the transition to the 2.0 version, and that’s why I’ve started the formal qualification for IT. </p>

             <h3> Jye Thomson - s3922877 </h3>
             <br />
             <p> Hey, my name is Jye Thomson and I am Currently living and working in Western Sydney, I work full time as an Apple Authorized technician and study in the evenings. I enjoy working on my car, driving, collecting music, growing plants and fixing old Macs. My interests in IT include programming, building PCs, repairing computers and implementing IT solutions in the education sector (this ties in with my job). </p>
             <p> My current IT experience is in PC building and Apple product repairs. I’ve built a few Windows based computers over the years, and I repair Apple products for a living. I also sell MacBooks, iPhones, Chromebooks and other related products to schools and students. I’m currently taking Intro to IT and Intro to Programming to further immerse myself in the industry. I’m excited to be part of the Essential Solutions team.  </p>
             <br />
             <h3> Neil Sheelin - s3923582 </h3>
             <br />
             <p> My name’s Neil Sheelin. I completed a certificate III in cookery and a diploma in hospitality management at TAFE in 2008. Currently I work as a senior Sous Chef at a Sydney hotel. I enjoy a broad range of pastime including baking, snorkeling, snooker, and hydroponics.  I genuinely love to spend time diving into any computer related activities. </p>
             <p> Programming is my main fascination. It allows me to make a computer do things the way I like. Whilst others use the program, I could make one. How awesome is that and it’s like everyone enjoyed a movie that was directed by me. Here I’d like to quote a remark from Dropbox founder Drew H., he said ‘It’s the closest thing we have to a superpower.’  I haven’t earned a cent through working in IT as I’m now still in a preliminary academic learning stage. However, I do have a good grasp on C++ language due to a course completion at a university I used to study at.  </p>
